## ðŸ§© Furball Essentials

**Solo-developed systems architecture prototype** I made this website several years ago for a friend. I am deciding to
leave it on my github to strengthen my portfolio by hopefully helping prove how long I have been developing things and
by showing I have knowledge of HTML and CSS.
