# ðŸŽ¨ Legacy Personal Website â€” [Friend's Name] Portfolio

> _Originally built in 2019 â€¢ Archived and maintained as part of my web development portfolio_

## ðŸ“œ Overview

This is a personal portfolio website I designed and developed for a friend back in 2019. Despite its age, it still holds up as a clean, responsive showcase of early front-end development work.
I've decided to preserve it here as a historical piece in my portfolio, highlighting my early understanding of HTML/CSS, responsive layouts, and lightweight UX design.

While some aspects are dated, it reflects my design sensibilities and technical capabilities at the time â€” as well as a commitment to aesthetic coherence and functional delivery.
